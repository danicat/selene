# Mutation Testing with Selene

This issue is to track the improvement of our test suite's efficiency and coverage using mutation testing. By introducing small logic changes into the codebase, we can verify if our existing tests are robust enough to catch them.

## Instructions for Contributors

### 1. Install Selene
You will need the [Selene](https://github.com/danicat/selene) mutation testing tool installed on your system:

```bash
go install github.com/danicat/selene@latest
```
*Note: Ensure your `$GOPATH/bin` is in your system `PATH`.*

### 2. Run Mutation Tests
Run Selene on the package(s) you wish to analyze. The tool will automatically skip code not currently covered by tests to focus on existing test logic.

```bash
# Run on the entire project
selene run ./...

# Or run on a specific package
selene run ./internal/mypackage/...
```

### 3. Analyze and Fix
Look for the following in the report:
*   **Survived**: These are logic changes that your tests **did not catch**. You should add or improve test assertions to ensure these mutations are killed.
*   **Uncovered**: These are areas of the code that have **no test coverage**. You should add new tests to exercise these blocks.

### 4. Report and Submit
When you are ready to submit your findings:
1.  **Comment below** with the full output of the Selene report.
2.  **Open a Pull Request** that adds the necessary tests to kill the survived mutations or cover the uncovered ones.
3.  Include a reference to this issue in your PR description.
